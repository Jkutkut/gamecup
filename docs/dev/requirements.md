## Foundations:
- N players.
- M teams.
- N >= M
- Team:

## Drafts:
- We can have N players.
- We can have M teams of N / M players in each team.
  - N >= M
- We can store the points of each team.
- We can visualize the points of each team.
- We can visualize the ranking of teams
  - By points

- The players can be registered at runtime:
  - Name
- The teams must be created before playing
  - Once started, no more teams can be created.
